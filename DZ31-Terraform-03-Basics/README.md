## Домашняя работа к занятию "7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"

#### Задача 1

```
terraform workspace list
  default
* prod
  stage
```

#### Задача 2

Не понял, как сделать здание 2.5 "Создайте рядом еще один aws_instance, но теперь определите их количество при помощи for_each, а не count."
Не работают workspace при использовании S3 backend (не переключается и не выводит список, хота в S3 всё создаётся)

```
terraform plan

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
